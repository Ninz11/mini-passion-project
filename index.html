        <p><em>Coffee</em>is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly
            acidic, coffee has a
            stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. Decaffeinated coffee is also
            commercially
            available.Coffee has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.

            The seeds from coffee cherries (the Coffea plant's fruits) are separated to produce
            unroasted green coffee beans. The "beans" are roasted and then ground into fine particles, which are
            typically
            steeped in hot water before being filtered out. It is usually served <strong>hot</strong>,
            although <strong>chilled</strong> or <strong>iced</strong> coffee is common. </p>
